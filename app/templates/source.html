<p class="text-center">The OakNews online presence includes a comprehensive news website and archive. The OakNews first official online service was the OAK Networking Club, which was launched on 11 May 1994. Ratings figures suggest that during major incidents such as the 7 July 2005 London bombings or royal events, the UK audience overwhelmingly turns to our news coverage as opposed to its commercial rivals.On 7 July 2005, the day that there were a series of coordinated bomb blasts on London's public transport system, the OakNews Online website recorded an all time bandwidth peak of 11 Gb/s at 12.00 on 7 July. OakNews received some 1 billion total hits on the day of the event (including all images, text, and HTML), serving some 5.5 terabytes of data. At peak times during the day, there were 40,000-page requests per second for the OakNews website. The previous day's announcement of the 2012 Olympics being awarded in London caused a peak of around 5 Gbit/s. The previous all-time high at OakNews Online was caused by the announcement of the Michael Jackson verdict.</p>
